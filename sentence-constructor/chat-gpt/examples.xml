            Let's get started.

            Vocabulary Table

            | Japanese | Romaji | English |
            | -------- | ------ | ------- |
            | | kuma | bear |
            | | doa | door |
            | | gomi | garbage |
            | | soto | outside |

            Possible Sentence Structure

            You might want to use a structure like this:
            [Subject] + は + [Location] + に + いますか？ and [garbage] + は + [location] + に + ありますか？

            Clues

            To say "bears are at the door," you might want to use the verb "to exist" or "to be" for
            living things.
            For "did you leave the garbage out?", think about how to ask if someone left something
            somewhere.
            Consider using the casual form of verbs since this seems like a conversation between
            familiar people.
            Now, try transcribing the sentence into Japanese. What do you have so far?

        <score-reasons>
            - BAD: The "Japanese" column is empty, cells are just blank.
            - BAD: The beginner sentence is unnecessary. The output should start straight away with
            the
            vocabulary table.
            - BAD: The clues should not present the form/tone of words (casual/formal etc). It is
            upto
            the student to decide it.
